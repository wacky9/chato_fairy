That’s doesn’t mean I’m “pro-China” (whatever that means), as I hope the Chinese government loses its battle with pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong.\xa0 I’m pro-neoliberalism, which I’ll support any time and any place in the world.\n\nSpeaking of neoliberalism, this FT editorial is another sign of the decline and fall of Western Civilization:\n\nIt’s sad to see former neoliberal media outlets such as the FT and The Economist move in a statist direction.\xa0 A younger generation seems to have forgotten all the lessons of the final 3 decades of the 20th century.\xa0 I suppose some people would cite a quote attributed to Keynes:\n\nWhen the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, Sir?\n\nSo let’s consider the facts:'), Document(id='ace43347-6062-44ec-9da9-64a09103cff1', metadata={'source': '/app/data/test_file.txt'}, page_content='In a world where voters paid attention to information content, Trump might run into problems. But voters see no inconsistency here, because the tweets consistently sound good.\n\nIt looks like I was wrong in my earlier post about Trump’s tariff announcement signaling a desire to get an agreement.\xa0 Either he never intended that strategy, or China’s tough response made it impossible.\xa0 (Maybe the Chinese read my blog.)\n\nObviously if Trump is frightened of the political consequences of 10%, his previous threat of 25% on the consumer imports is completely off the table.\xa0 The Chinese called his bluff, and he backed off like a dog with its tail between its legs.'), Document(id='8101b7e0-6621-4115-b770-e5d4e078e835', metadata={'source': '/app/data/test_file.txt'}, page_content='When I listen to the Rolling Stones, I often cannot understand the lyrics. But then the lyrics don’t matter, at least in terms of “information content”. All that matters is whether they sound good when Mick Jagger sings them. And they often sound very good.\n\nWhen I listen to Trump, the information content often makes no sense. He’s going to pay off the entire national debt in 8 years? And he’s going to do so with tariff revenue? Well . . . that does sound good.\n\nIt sounds good when Trump announces that he’ll declare a trade war on big bad China, using higher tariffs. And it sounds even better when he reassures us that the tariffs won’t raise prices because they’ll be paid for by the Chinese. And it sounds even better when he announces that the tariffs will be delayed so that they won’t hurt our Christmas shoppers.'), Document(id='bd75cac0-9393-4b5b-9187-caab03f813ba', metadata={'source': '/app/data/test_file.txt'}, page_content='In the same edition of the FT is another headline, a reminder of what statist policies do to an economy:\n\nI hope Tyler Cowen will hurry up and write his book entitled “The Great Forgetting.”\n\nWe’ve forgotten that monetary policy drives NGDP, and that fiscal policy is a fifth wheel.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that trade deficits are not a problem and budget deficits are.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that industrial policies don’t work.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that price, rent, and wage controls don’t work.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that saving is a virtue.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that low interest rates don’t mean money is easy.\xa0 We’ve forgotten how to build infrastructure. We’ve forgotten that nationalism is one of the great evils of world history.\xa0 We’ve forgotten that socialism is another of the great evils of world history.\n\nHere’s Mick:\n\nOh, a storm is threat’ning\n\nAt least I think that’s what he said.\n\nPS.\xa0 Brian asked me to talk about monetary policy.\xa0 Hey Fed, cut rates by 50 basis points.\n\nHT:\xa0 Stephen Kirchner\n\nTags:')]

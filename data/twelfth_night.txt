Twelfth Night, or What You Will is one of William Shakespeare’s most celebrated and frequently performed comedies, written around 1601 or 1602. The title refers to the Twelfth Night holiday (January 5th), which marked the end of the Christmas season in Elizabethan England—a time of revelry, role reversals, and celebration. True to that spirit, the play is filled with mistaken identities, gender-swapping, romantic confusion, and festive chaos.

The story is set in the fictional land of Illyria and begins with a shipwreck that separates the twin siblings Viola and Sebastian. Believing her brother to be dead, Viola disguises herself as a young man named Cesario to find work and ends up serving Duke Orsino. Orsino is deeply in love with the noblewoman Olivia, who refuses his advances while mourning her own brother. Viola, as Cesario, is sent by Orsino to woo Olivia on his behalf, but Olivia falls in love with Cesario instead, unaware of Viola’s true identity. Meanwhile, Viola herself has fallen for Orsino, creating a tangled triangle of affection—Orsino loves Olivia, Olivia loves Cesario, and Viola loves Orsino.

Sebastian, who has survived the shipwreck, eventually arrives in Illyria. People begin to confuse him with Cesario, leading to further complications, including Olivia mistakenly marrying Sebastian, thinking he is the same person she fell in love with. Eventually, the confusion is cleared: Viola reveals her true identity, Sebastian and Olivia remain happily married, and Orsino realizes he loves Viola, bringing the main romantic plots to a joyful conclusion.

Running alongside the main story is a comical and somewhat darker subplot involving Olivia’s pompous steward, Malvolio. He is tricked into believing that Olivia loves him through a fake letter written by her maid, Maria, with the help of Olivia’s mischievous uncle Sir Toby Belch and the foolish Sir Andrew Aguecheek. Malvolio is humiliated and imprisoned, and although he is eventually released, he exits vowing revenge. This subplot provides much of the play’s slapstick and farce, though it also leaves the audience with questions about cruelty and justice in comedy.

The major characters in the play include Viola, who is clever, witty, and resilient, taking on the disguise of Cesario to survive in a strange land. Orsino, the romantic and somewhat melodramatic duke, is introduced in the very first scene with the famous line, “If music be the food of love, play on.” Olivia is noble and independent, and quickly becomes smitten with Cesario, despite her mourning. Sebastian, Viola’s twin, plays a crucial role in the play’s mistaken identities. Malvolio represents pride and self-deception, while Sir Toby and Sir Andrew embody festive misrule. Maria is cunning and resourceful, and Feste, the fool, is one of Shakespeare’s most insightful clowns—offering wisdom disguised as humor.

The play explores several recurring themes. Love and desire appear in multiple forms—romantic, unrequited, and irrational. Gender and identity are at the center of the play’s plot, as Viola’s disguise challenges traditional roles and expectations. Festivity and foolery dominate the tone, reflecting the holiday spirit the title evokes. The contrast between melancholy and joy is also important, particularly in the characters of Viola and Malvolio, who each endure different kinds of emotional turmoil.

Many of the lines from Twelfth Night have become famous over time. Among them are “If music be the food of love, play on,” spoken by Orsino, and “Better a witty fool than a foolish wit,” from Feste. Malvolio's quote from the fake letter—“Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ’em”—is also widely recognized and often quoted.

Twelfth Night has inspired countless adaptations and reinterpretations. On stage, it is a favorite among Shakespeare festivals and repertory theatres, often performed with gender-bending casts and modern updates. In film, it has been adapted traditionally, such as in Trevor Nunn’s 1996 version, and more loosely in modern retellings like the teen comedy She’s the Man (2006), starring Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum. Television and radio have also hosted many productions of the play.

There are some interesting facts worth noting. The subtitle “What You Will” implies a kind of freedom and playfulness in interpretation. While most of the play is lighthearted, the treatment of Malvolio has long been debated for its harshness, blurring the line between comedy and cruelty. Feste, the fool, often emerges as one of the wisest characters in the play, challenging assumptions about who is truly foolish and who understands the world best.
